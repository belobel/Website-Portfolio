        <h4>Getting a start </h4>
        <p>There have been a lot of things which I have needed to sort out before I got started with my website such as
            setting up my git and github and thinking about what I want my website to look like. In terms of look for
            now I have decided to go for a dark theme and so when I started to make my homepage I have just made the
            background black and the text white to get an idea. I've spent a lot of time looking at the page and just
            thought the darker theme centered around black would not work. Starting has been hard and at this point I
            can not see how the front page will look at all and this is a problem as I do think I can't continue with
            the progress of the other pages if I don't figure out what I do with the front page. For now I just decided
            to do rough templates of the other pages and forget about the design.

        <h4>Paddings, borders and steady progress with design</h4>
        <p>As I have been focusing with basic layout more and more and looking where to position things on the page
            padding has been one of the elements which I have used throughout my all pages and one that has taken me a
            long time to get the result I wanted and I am constantly changing the value of my paddings if I change one
            thing or if a position just does not look right. I've used padding for moving my text to be positioned more
            at centre or to push text vertically down. Whilst progressing with my pages design wise for pages with
            columns I've really wanted the columns to have soft round edges opposed to the sharp edged boxes and so I
            have been using the border-radius as they seem more easy to follow. Speaking of designs, I have made some
            steady progress with the design in terms of colour. The palette which I have thought of has constantly
            changed from me wanting a black and purple palette to a pink and brown palette to a blue and green palette
            to then a mixture of the various paletes in mind. Choosing and sticking to colours is not an easy task and
            it was hard to envision what the pages would turn out to be as I just had so many colours in my head but
            after a while I tried again with my home page and can finally see that my main colour was going to be a
            green and so I can kind of see how my other pages will look like. </p>
