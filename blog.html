        <h4>Getting a start </h4>
        <p>There have been a lot of things which I have needed to sort out before I got started with my website such as
            setting up my git and github and thinking about what I want my website to look like. In terms of look for
            now I have decided to go for a dark theme and so when I started to make my homepage I have just made the
            background black and the text white to get an idea. I've spent a lot of time looking at the page and just
            thought the darker theme centered around black would not work. Starting has been hard and at this point I
            can not see how the front page will look at all and this is a problem as I do think I can't continue with
            the progress of the other pages if I don't figure out what I do with the front page. For now I just decided
            to do rough templates of the other pages and forget about the design.

        <h4>Paddings, borders and steady progress with design</h4>
        <p>As I have been focusing with basic layout more and more and looking where to position things on the page
            padding has been one of the properties which I have used throughout my all pages and one that has taken me a
            long time to get the result I wanted. I am constantly changing the value of my paddings if I change one
            thing or if a position just does not look right. I've used padding for moving my text to be positioned more
            at centre or to push text vertically down. Whilst progressing with my pages design wise for pages with
            columns I've really wanted the columns to have soft round edges opposed to the sharp edged boxes and so I
            have been using the border-radius to do this as the round edges seem more easy to follow and easy to the eyes. Speaking of designs, I have made some
            steady progress with the design in terms of colour. The palette which I have thought of has constantly
            changed from me wanting a black and purple palette to a pink and brown palette to a blue and green palette
            to then a mixture of the various paletes in mind. Choosing and sticking to colours is not an easy task and
            it was hard to envision what the pages would turn out to be as I just had so many colours in my head but
            after a while I tried again with my home page and can finally see that my main colour was going to be a
            green and so I can kind of see how my other pages will look like now. </p>

        <h4>Errors, animation and mobile responsiveness</h4>

       <p> There were quite a few errors I had to fix up as I was checking back up on my html codes from needing to put my
        navigation under the "nav" tag forgetting to put the "/html" end tag at the end and having to find solutions to sections where I could not use a tag under a certain tag since
        they were not allowed as a child of the element. Animations I decided to keep it very simple and only to the first page
        I dont think it's needed on the other pages so I just added a fade in effect to the whole page and a bounce effect to my
        title header. The responsiveness of the pages took time for me to do as it took me some time to make it work for the
        index page and just like when I could not see how my design would like if the index page was not done I could not
        continue with the responsiveness with the other pages but once I got it done for the index page the responsiveness for
        all the other pages was easy to do and I had to make very minimal changes and finished it off by adding my menu to the
        responsive css section.</p>
