        <h4>Module Experience<br></h4>
        <p>
            In web development I definitely learnt a lot as this was my first experience with knowing how websites are
            made,
            I was introduced to new languages (html and css) and new concepts. I learnt a lot of basic things such as
            how to
            write up my file and how the words are layed out. Learning how to do coding for web development and the
            basic
            format for it was not hard at all and I found it relatively easy to understand. For the design process I
            felt
            like I did not really go into depth with that and just did not focus on it much at all throughout my
            experience
            and was just not very experimental with it at all. Throughout my experience I've always had to debug
            something.
            A lot of the debugging I did were just simple errors such as forgetting this ‘>’ symbol or just using
            incorrect
            or unnecessary tags and methods. The debugging process was one of the major things that helped me understand
            how
            to do my coding more as I had better ways to set out my codes.<br>

            <br>Throughout my experience there were things that I really enjoyed such as doing the link for pages and
            making
            forms. I don't really know why but it's just something I really enjoyed doing. I really also liked my
            journey of
            learning how to code for web development and constantly improving on it and learning new skills. The biggest
            thing which I liked when it came to the experience was when something that I worked so hard to understand to
            work finally worked and came out how I was expecting it to.<br>

            <br> There were a few hard things when it came to me whilst learning web development that being
            grids/columns, mobile
            response and github and branches. Making columns and grids was definitely the first section of the course
            which
            I had to do more research about as I was simply not getting it but after just taking my time with it I can
            definitely say I am more confident with the use of grids and making columns. Mobile response was another
            part
            that was hard for me as although when doing the exercises and making my web page responsive, the page will
            show
            up without the addition front the design from the css file which was linked to my pages so mobile response
            was
            probably the worst section for me personally when it came to this course as it just wasn't working out for
            me so
            I just decided to leave it not knowing what to do for a while. The use of branches and git hub was very
            confusing to me at first and I had to make and delete a few respiratories whilst trying to make a start on
            my
            website portfolio and it was only until I understood how to use it that I could finally start making my
            website
            for the assignment.<br>

            <br> Overall I can definitely say I've had a great experience with this and have not once felt like I would
            not
            produce something good or learn something from it especially with the fact that I knew nothing to begin
            with.

        <h4>Development Diary </h4>

        <h5>29/03/22</h5>
        Starting my first page(index) I added a header and an introductory statement. From the design aspect I've
        thought about doing a dark theme with a black purple type of palette. For now though that is just an idea and so
        I have decided to stop my work on my index page for now and work on a rough template for all my pages and then
        return to my index page as I want my other pages theme based on the index page.

        <br>
        <h5>04/03/22</h5>
        The background of my index page was added. I still am sure I wanted a dark theme but ended up deciding that
        black was not a good idea so opted for a dark green shade . The colours which are present on my home page
        (green,gold,brown and white) I think these colours work well together and will give a clean mature sophisticated
        type of look and so they are going to be the colours which my portfolio is going to work around so as I continue with
        my next pages I can progress more with their designs.

        <br>
        <h5>30/03/2022</h5>
        To make the column of the portfolipo page I decided to make 3 rows of columns: the header, main row, and then a third line with three
        separate and even columns. Height was used in each column section except from ‘header’ to help make me choose
        the length of the column I wanted and since I wanted my columns to be spaced I used ‘row-gap’ and ‘column-gap'
        in order to achieve this. For my portfolio page I am definitely sure that I just want this page to be plain and
        nothing going on for it apart from my column and when I start to add things to the columns.

        <br>
        <h5>31/03/22</h5>
        I wanted the navigation texts under the 'Portfolio' heading so I decided to use text-align:centre on all of the
        navigation texts. It did put my text in the centre but I wanted the text to be on the same line rather than on
        top of each other. So to put my text all on the same line I removed the text-align:centre and added
        display:inline on all of the navigation texts to put it on the same line. To push it to be centre I used
        padding-left only on the first navigation text ‘h2’ which reads ‘Home’ which shifted the line of texts towards
        the right and then to make space in between each words I added a ‘padding-right’ to ‘h2’(Home) ‘h3’(Blog)
        ‘h4’(Contact).

        <br>
        <h5>01/04/2022</h5>
        This day I just focused on the contact page and the headers I wanted on the page and making the form. Next time
        I work on this page I'll add more info to some of my text and start work on the design layout a bit.



        <br>
        <h5>02/04/2022</h5>
        Created the blog page draft/template which was very easy to do and make out the layout as I just used my
        portfolio page code as a base and just worked around that.

        <h5>03/04/2022</h5>
        Added the site report page and added in my paragraph for my module experience. At this point for this page I've
        not really thought about how it's going to be looked or designed.

        <br>
        <h5>05/04/22</h5>
        For my portfolio all I did today is make my column boxes a soft curve using ‘border-radius’. This is a stylistic
        decision I want as I feel it is less harsh on the eyes when looking at it and I'm also going to use this for the
        columns on my blog page as well. I also added the placeholder images in and for the images to fit my columns I
        used ‘background-size: contain’. I also worked on the contact page and tried to do a merge from my contact form
        to my master but I made a mistake at some point on how I used the branches so I just copied my code from the
        contact form branch onto my master branch. I fixed the width and heights of my form boxes to the sizes I wanted
        it to be. One thing I found today whilst doing this is my text area message box as the box would not say as one
        size and I could drag the box from the bottom right corner and change the size of the textarea when I wanted it
        to be a fixed position. It took time but I found that I could use ‘resize:none’ and set my width and length
        alongside this to make my text area not move.

        <br>
        <h5>06/04/22</h5>
        For the blog page I wanted the design to be light and fresh as I think my other pages (index and contact) were
        strong and dark. I used a lighter green on my column for the fresh look and added a shadow background on my
        columns and made the shadow a teal green which was seen on the contact page to help keep on theme. The page
        background was kept white to keep it light and more easy on the eyes and overall I think a more relaxed and
        simple look was the best thing for this page. I also completed the design of the contact page and for this I
        want the green to be the main colour of the page with hints of the other colours from my theme. At first I thought that I would
        have my left column be a different colour and the rest of the page the same colour and do a separate design for
        the left column with rounded edges. But then I decided that I wanted the page to be the same colour throughout
        with minimal designs using the colours from my theme.



        <br>
        <h5>07/04/2022</h5>
        On my site report page I added ‘br’ to my module experience to create space between my paragraphs as I did not
        want the text together.Links were then added to all pages and designed and I also fixed some errors on my page
        and tags.I removed all the unnecessary h1-h6 that I used for my navigation headers as I realised I can repeat
        the same ‘h’ tag on all my navigation texts and they will work the same instead of using h1-6 and having a
        multiple sections on the css side as well.


        <br>
        <h5>11/04/2022</h5>
        I just focused on fixing the tags for my pages.


        <br>
        <h5>12/04/2022</h5>
        Began my first responsive design on my index page and added a hamburger menu code which I found online and made a few
        adjustments to that code so it can work for my website.

        <br>
        <h5>13/04/22</h5>
        I worked on the responsive design for my portfolio page and changed the layout of my columns so that the columns
        on the responsive side will stack on top of each other and to make sure that my columns work with the
        responsiveness I changed the grid-template-columns from being auto to 100%.

        <br>
        <h5>14/04/22</h5>
        Worked on the blog page responsiveness which was quick to do as I just based it off the portfolio pages one and
        did the same thing by stacking the columns on top of each other and changing the grid-template-columns to be
        100% instead of auto. I then went back to all pages to make sure I used my tags correctly and so made sure to
        add a ‘nav’ tag to all my pages navigation section as I had left my navigation section under the “header” tag
        alone.

        <br>
        <h5>15/04/22</h5>
        I added animations to my index page that were a fade in effect on the whole page and a bounce effect on my title
        ‘h3’ of my name using a ‘transition:translatey’ so it can move up and down along the y axis. For both of my
        animations I just used the animation property which has multiple different animation properties in it to
        simplify it for myself and then used this alongside a keyframe to make the fade in effect by making the page
        opacity change.I then added the hamburger menu to all of the pages remaining which did not have the hamburger
        menu. I added another set of links for the hamburger menu separate from the ‘nav’ to make the menu. As ‘a’ was
        not allowed as a child under the element ‘ul’ and I needed that bit for the menu to work I just added a ‘li’ in
        between it so it can work. To make my hamburger menu not visible on my non responsive pages I added a
        display:none and visibility:collapse to the hamburger menu so it would not show up and vice versa to make the
        navigation not show up on my mobile pages I added a display:none to my ‘nav’ under the css file.

        <br>
        <h5>16/04/22</h5>
        I finished the design for my site report page today and decided to go for a lighter colour like the blog page as
        I know this page will have a lot of information on it so I thought it would be easier on the eyes. The page
        overall is very much simple and I do not think it needs a lot going on it.I further also added in images of my
        site development on this page as well and my validations.

   <br> All html lines were used for all my html pages and this was so the navigation link and close link for the menu can
    be made. All css lines were used for all ‘screen’ css pages and this was to position the hamburger, make the
    navigation be seen and to make the design and transitions .
